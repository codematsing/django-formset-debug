**This missing widgets and form manipulation library for Django**

``<django-formset>`` is a web component to let the browser pre-validate and manipulate one or more
Django ``Form``-s. This facilitates developers to build beautiful forms with a contemporary user
experience. This library ships with a set of widgets, which integrate seamlessly with their
Django's counterparts.
