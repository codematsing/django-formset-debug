Contributing to the Project
===========================

* Please ask question on the `discussion board`_.
* Ideas for new features shall be discussed on that board as well.
* The `issue tracker`_ must *exclusively* be used to report bugs.
* Except for very small fixes (typos etc.), do not open a pull request without an issue.

Writing Code
============

Before hacking into the code, adopt your IDE to respect the projects's `.editorconfig`_ file.

.. _.editorconfig: https://editorconfig.org/

When installing from GitHub, you *must* build the project from scratch as described in
section :ref:`development`.


Reporting Bugs
==============

For me it often is very difficult to comprehend why this library does not work with *your* project.
Therefore wheneever you want to report a bug, **report it in a way so that I can reproduce it**.

**Checkout the code, build the client and run the demo** as decribed in the previous section.
Every feature offered by **django-formset** is implemented in the demo named ``testapp``.
If you can reproduce the bug there, report it. **Otherwise check why your application behaves
differently**.

If you have a special setup which triggers a bug, clone this project and rebuild an example in
``testapp``, so that I can run that sample in a reproducile way.


Adding new Features
===================

If you want to add a new feature to **django-formset**, please first describe your intention on the
discussion board. It will save you and me hours of wasteless work, **because I will not merge
unsolicited pull requests**.

*Don't hide yourself*: I will not accept large pull requests from anonymous users, so please publish
an email address in your GitHub's profile. Reason is that when refactoring the code, I must be
able to contact the initial author of a feature not added by myself. I also will not accept large
pull requests from unsigned commits.

Don't be offended, if I don't respond immediatly. I have many projects on GitHub which all require
their maintainance share. Feel free to invite me to conferences or ping me on Twitter_ or LinkedIn_.

If you add a new feature, there must be working example in ``testapp``. Doing so has three benefits:

* I can understand way better what it does and how that new feature works. This increases the
  chances of being accepted and merged.
* You can use that same code to adopt the test suite.
* Everybody can manually test, how that feature looks and feels in various CSS frameworks.

*Remember*: For UI-centric applications such as this one, where the client- and server-side are
strongly entangled with each other, I prefer end-to-end tests way more rather than unit tests.
Reason is, that otherwise I would have to mock the interfaces, which itself is error-prone and
additional work.


Quoting
=======

Please follow these rules when quoting strings:

* A string intended to be read by humans shall be quoted using double quotes: `"…"`.
* An internal string, such as dictionary keys, etc. (and thus usually not intended to be read by
  humans), shall be quoted using single quotes: `'…'`. This makes it easier to determine if we have
  to extra check for wording.

There is a good reason to follow this rule: Strings intended for humans, sometimes contain
apostrophes, for instance `"This is John's profile"`. By using double quotes, those apostrophes must
not be escaped. On the other side whenever we write HTML, we have to use double quotes for
parameters, for instance `'<a href="https://example.org">Click here!</a>'`. By using single quotes,
those double quotes do not have to be escaped.


Lists versus Tuples
===================

Unfortunately in Django and Python, `we developers far too often
<https://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/h4FSYWzMJhs>`_ intermixed lists and tuples without
being aware of their intention. Therefore please follow this rule:

Always use lists, if there is a theoretical possibility that someday, someone might add another
item. Therefore ``list_display``, ``list_display_links``, ``fields``, etc. must always be lists.

Always use tuples, if the number of items is restricted by nature, and there isn't even a
theoretical possibility of being extended.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

	color = ChoiceField(
	    label="Color",
	    choices=[('ff0000', "Red"), ('00ff00', "Green"), ('0000ff', "Blue")],
	)

A ``ChoiceField`` must provide a list of choices. Attribute ``choices`` must be a list because
it is eligible for extension. Its inner items however must be tuples, because they can exlusively
containin the choice value and a human readable label. Here we also intermix single with double
quotes to distinguish strings intended to be read by the machine versus a human.
